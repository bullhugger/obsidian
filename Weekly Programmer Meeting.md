<span style="font-size:1.5em;">Why?</span>
Because we often wouldn't know what is the suitable solution to a problem. It helps to have a second or third set of eyes looking for the most suitable solution. Generally the path to being better at something is by teaching others or asking question.

Of course it is often times faster by working on something without distraction, alone. That being said, there will come a time where someone have to pick up where we left off. And if there is no consistent method, structure, it will only prolong the time it takes for the next person to understand what has been done and start contributing.

<span style="font-size:1.5em;">So what should we do?</span>
**Stand up :**
8:30am begin meeting on the start of the week. (Monday or whichever first day of the week) Before everyone starts working on their own module / support for the day. Once or twice a week depending on the need.

<span style="font-size:1.5em;">Who should attend stand up?</span>
Everyone.

<span style="font-size:1.5em;">What's in a stand up?</span>
Describe what you have done and responsibility or goal for the week. Generally this stand up meeting shouldn't be longer than 15 minutes, which is why its called stand up.

<span style="font-size: 1.5em;">How?</span>
Talk about the thing you are working on, worked on and what challenges you are facing with the thing you are working on if any. Don't dive into the fine details, just a brief description. Here are two examples:

----------------------------------------------------------


	I added unit details picture and comment section for progressive. Currently working on converting jpg to webp format for storage purpose. Terminal may or may not accept webp format.

----------------------------------------------------------

	Supported issues with mismatched SDNR, terminal offline for weeks, incorrect submission by purchasing all resolved. Currently working on support for accounting Jennie, she requires the rounding to be 3 decimal based instead, remove team input field for worker in project, continuing development of qr code generation for inventory tracking.

----------------------------------------------------------

Should you require more help, you should talk to someone who can after the stand up. So that others can go back and start their work.

<span style="font-size: 1.5em;">Whats next?</span>
**Code review** when necessary at the end of the week.
Where a person have to present their code to the team and be criticized for their work. Only one person module per week. 

<span style="font-size: 1.5em;">Do I have to wait for stand up or code review before proceeding to the next portion of my work?</span>
No, you can save the details for the next stand up.
